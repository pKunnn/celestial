# About Celestial
Celestial Bot is going to be a free open-source bot that tries to replicate almost all features (paid and non-paid) from other famous bots!

The actual reason why i created this repository and bot it's because i really don't like those goofy ahh bots that tries to make you pay for literally anything.
Also i hate that blue bot with a smile face on their pfp.

Celestial name and pfp is ofcourse a reference to Celeste and Madeline. (The profile picture is literally Madeline but in the future i will change to avoid any legal stuff).

# Why Celestial?
Celestial was created as a spiritual sequence to my old DBM bot named as FlutterBot, my first functional discord bot. (Kinda cringe cause i didn't code shit).

Celestial is my first big project, the objective is not end all other bots or make the discord bot community communist (i wish), the true objective is to prove myself that i can re-create any command that the other bots have.
My big inspiration to this bot is Loritta (For being made by a brazilian dev, just like me, and having a lot of cool features).
