##### `I lost focus of my main purpose to this bot.` 
##### `So, for now its just another wip discord bot. ` 
###### I will still update the bot tho. (and yes, this bot is very VERY simple)


# Why Celestial?
Celestial was created as a spiritual sequence to my old DBM bot named as FlutterBot, my first functional discord bot. (Kinda cringe cause i didn't code shit).

Celestial is my first big project, the objective is not end all other bots or make the discord bot community communist (i wish), the true objective is to prove myself that i can re-create any command that the other bots have.
My big inspiration to this bot is Loritta (For being made by a brazilian dev, just like me, and having a lot of cool features).
